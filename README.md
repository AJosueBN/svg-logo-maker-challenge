# week-10-svg-logo-maker-challenge Building a Node command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file.          Prompts user to select color,shape and text for the logo.   

# This project involves the use of JavaScript, Node and Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) and can be tested through Jest

# Things added/implemented on to the task of generating an SVG Logo:

- Allowed terminal to accept user input with Inquirer involved and a promise function involved.                            Depending on the details the user has put in, those details will then be displayed on the logo.svg file from the prompted enquiries that have been asked 
- When the user is prompted for text (up to three characters),shape colour and the type of shape(circle , square , triangle) and once the terminal has accepted all of its input for all of the prompts, then an SVG file will be generated using a logo.svg file and prints that it has generated onto the terminal
- Depending on the input given within the command-line interface, the results can be displayed on a browser and can be shown a 300x200 pixel image which matches the criteria that the user has entered.
